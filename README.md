### Interpretable Independent representation learning for Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factor Discovery by integrating omics and non-omics (OnO) data from the UKBiobank

Health disparities

We need to understand if there are health disparities between different ethnic groups in the context of diabetes. For example, if there is a clinical factor/genetic factor that has a higher importance in one ethnic group than in a another for diabetic patients. To understand how different features contribute to produce the right prediction depending on the ethnic group, we can:

Independent Learning - We tried 3 ML models for each category of EthnicGroup and compared the list of ranked features. If there is a difference between feature importances - that may be interesting in the context of health disparities between ethnic groups.
